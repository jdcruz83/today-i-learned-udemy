This app has been made following the "Crash Course: Build a Full-Stack Web App in a Weekend!" from Udemy.
This covers HTML and CSS, Vanilla JavaScript and the ReactJS framework.

## What have I changed/implemented already:

- Hide overflow-y, was showing in certain window sizes;
- Changed to `overflow: auto;` Was showing scroll bar when not necessary;
- Added the category to the `<span class="tag"></span>` below Facts list;
